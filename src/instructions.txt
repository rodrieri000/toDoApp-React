yank out all the unnecessary code and begin building a todo app

create state for your app.js with isClicked: false in it

create a button and add an on-click handler that changes the value of isClicked

create a input field then a function that changes state of text: '' to the e.target.value onChange of the input field

change your onClickHandler function to push into the value of todos: [] the text

Now clear text in the same function.

Once you have state being changed properly create an element for each of the items in todos: []

Now .map() over todos and show each item in the DOM. REMEMBER to give the callback function in .map() and
 index and provide that to each of the elements as index={index}

Create a button on each of the elements that use this and when clicked removes/deletes the item from todos: []
